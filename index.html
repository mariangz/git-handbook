            <p>A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on
              projects together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the
              confidence that any version can be recovered at any time. Developers can review project history to find
              out:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which changes were made?</li>

            <p>Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS) commonly used for open source and
              commercial software development. DVCSs allow full access to every file, branch, and iteration of a
              project, and allows every user access to a full and self-contained history of all changes. Unlike once
              popular centralized version control systems, DVCSs like Git don’t need a constant connection to a central
              repository. Developers can work anywhere and collaborate asynchronously from any time zone.</p>
            <p>Without version control, team members are subject to redundant tasks, slower timelines, and multiple
              copies of a single project. To eliminate unnecessary work, Git and other VCSs give each contributor a
              unified and consistent view of a project, surfacing work that’s already in progress. Seeing a transparent
              history of changes, who made them, and how they contribute to the development of a project helps team
              members stay aligned while working independently.</p>

          <article>
            <p>According to the latest <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology"> Stack
                Overflow developer survey</a>, more than 70 percent of developers use Git,
              making it the most-used VCS in the world. Git is commonly used for both open source and commercial
              software development, with significant benefits for individuals, teams and businesses.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes, decisions, and progression of any
                project in one place. From the moment they access the history of a project, the developer has all the
                context they need to understand it and start contributing.</li>
              <li>Developers work in every time zone. With a DVCS like Git, collaboration can happen any time while
                maintaining source code integrity. Using branches, developers can safely propose changes to production
                code.</li>
              <li>Businesses using Git can break down communication barriers between teams and keep them focused on
                doing their best work. Plus, Git makes it possible to align experts across a business to collaborate on
                major projects.</li>

          </header>
          <article>
            <p>A repository, or <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git project</a>, encompasses the entire collection of
              files and folders associated with a
              project, along with each file’s revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called
              commits, and the commits exist as a linked-list relationship, and can be organized into multiple lines of
              development called branches. Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who
              owns a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line or
              other ease-of-use interfaces, a git repository also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning,
              creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of code, and more.</p>
            <p>Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and protected. Developers are encouraged to
              fix bugs, or create fresh features, without fear of derailing mainline development efforts. Git
              facilitates this through the use of topic branches: lightweight pointers to commits in history that can be
              easily created and deprecated when no longer needed.</p>
            <p>Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more opportunities for project transparency and
              collaboration. Public repositories help teams work together to build the best possible final product.</p>

              Basic Git commands
            </h2>
          </header>
          <article>
            <p>To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy, create, change, and combine code. These commands
              can be executed directly from the command line or by using an application like <a
                href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> or Git
              Kraken. Here are some common commands for using Git:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>git init</code> initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing
                directory. It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data
                structure required for version control.</li>
              <li><code>git clone</code> creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone
                includes all the project’s files, history, and branches.</li>
              <li><code>git add</code> stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer’s codebase, but it’s necessary
                to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project’s history. This command
                performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a
                part of the next snapshot and a part of the project’s history. Staging and committing separately gives
                developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.
              </li>
              <li><code>git commit</code> saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking
                process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that’s been staged with <code>git
                  add</code> will become a part of the snapshot with <code>git commit</code>.</li>
              <li><code>git status</code> shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.</li>
              <li><code>git branch</code> shows the branches being worked on locally.</li>
              <li><code>git merge</code> merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine
                changes made on two distinct branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to combine
                changes from a feature branch into the main branch for deployment.</li>
              <li><code>git pull</code> updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart.
                Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like
                to reflect those changes in their local environment.</li>
              <li><code>git push</code> updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.</li>
            </ul>

          <p>GitHub is a Git hosting repository that provides developers with tools to ship better code through command
            line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection of free
            and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace. With collaboration layers like the GitHub flow, a community
            of 15 million developers, and an ecosystem with hundreds of integrations, GitHub changes the way software is
            built.</p>

              How GitHub works
            </h2>
          </header>
          <p>GitHub builds collaboration directly into the development process. Work is organized into repositories,
            where developers can outline requirements or direction and set expectations for team members. Then, using
            the GitHub flow, developers simply create a branch to work on updates, commit changes to save them, open a
            pull request to propose and discuss changes, and merge pull requests once everyone is on the same page.</p>

            </h2>
          </header>
          <p>The GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow built around core Git commands used by teams around
            the globe—including ours.</p>
          <p>The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when implemented:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a branch: Topic branches created from the canonical deployment branch (usually <code>main</code>)
              allow teams to contribute to many parallel efforts. Short-lived topic branches, in particular, keep teams
              focused and results in quick ships.</li>
            <li>Add commits: Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe, revertible points in the
              project’s history.</li>
            <li>Open a pull request: Pull requests publicize a project’s ongoing efforts and set the tone for a
              transparent development process.</li>
            <li>Discuss and review code: Teams participate in code reviews by commenting, testing, and reviewing open
              pull requests. Code review is at the core of an open and participatory culture.</li>
            <li>Merge: Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’
              operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.</li>
            <li>Deploy: Teams can choose the best release cycles or incorporate continuous integration tools and operate
              with the assurance that code on the deployment branch has gone through a robust workflow.</li>
          </ol>

              write, or administrator access. This simple permission structure, combined with features like protected
              branches and Marketplace, helps teams progress quickly when they adopt GitHub.

              For an open source project, or for projects to which anyone can contribute, managing individual
              permissions can be challenging, but a fork and pull model allows anyone who can view the project to
              contribute. A fork is a copy of a project under an developer’s personal account. Every developer has full
              control of their fork and is free to implement a fix or new feature. Work completed in forks is either
              kept separate, or is surfaced back to the original project via a pull request. There, maintainers can
              review the suggested changes before they’re merged. See the <a
                href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">Projects Guide for more information</a> Forking.
